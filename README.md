## nbd-graph
#### HW - Networking for Big Data

- script to generate an p-Erdos-Renyi random graph
- script to generate an r-regular random graph
- script to check the connectivity of a given graph (eigenvalue Laplacian matrix, irreducibility, breadth-first search algorithm)
- compare the complexity of connectivity checking method as a function of n nodes
- probability that a graph is connected
- throughput performance
- reliability performance
